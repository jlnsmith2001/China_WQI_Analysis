## DATA DISCLAIMER
This dataset was synthetically generated and does not reflect real-world data. It is meant for exploratory analysis only. 
Station names, coordinates, and measurements are entirely fictional and were algorithmically randomized within realistic boundaries. 

## Dataset source
[China Water Pollution Monitoring Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khushikyad001/china-water-pollution-monitoring-dataset)

## Business Task
Analyze water quality data from 2023 to identify which regions in China experienced the highest pollution levels, detect seasonal trends in pollution, and highlight which pollutants were most frequently elevated.

## Visualizations include
- Geographic map showcasing monitoring stations and their average levels of pollution
- Heat map exploring seasonal trends among provinces
- Bar graph revealing which pollutants had the highest instances of reaching unsafe levels of contamination
- Column chart comparing which stations within  specific provinces had the highest averages

## Key Insights
- Most polluted provinces in china included Wuhan, Dali, Yichang, and Zhengzhou
- Spring and Winter tended to have higher levels of pollution
- Phosphorous, Ammonia, And Total Nitrogen were consistently at elevated levels across many stations.
- Stations in Zhengzhou and Yichang had high levels of Phosphorous throughout the entire year.

## Tools and Skills used
Google Sheets: Data cleaning through formulas, filters, and helper columns

Google Slides: Thorough explanations and findings 

Tableau: Interactive visualizations 

## Data Cleaning Summary
Created a copy of the raw dataset and cleaned it using Google Sheets. This process consisted of...
- Filtering out empty/irrelevant rows
- Renaming columns for clarity
- Creating helper columns for thresholds and regional validation
- Removing invalid data entries
This process enabled me to work with clean, structured data so I could focus my attention to answering my business task.
