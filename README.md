# China WQI Analysis
Data analysis case study using Spreadsheets and Tableau.

## DATA DISCLAIMER
This dataset was synthetically generated and does not reflect real-world data. It is meant for exploratory analysis only. 
Station names, coordinates, and measurements are entirely fictional and were algorithmically randomized within realistic boundaries. 

## Dataset source
[China Water Pollution Monitoring Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khushikyad001/china-water-pollution-monitoring-dataset)

## Business Task
Analyze water quality data from 2023 to identify which regions in China experienced the highest pollution levels, detect seasonal trends in pollution, and highlight which pollutants were most frequently elevated.

## Visualizations include
- Geographic map showcasing monitoring stations and their average levels of pollution
- Heat map exploring seasonal trends among provinces
- Bar graph revealing which pollutants had the highest instances of reaching unsafe levels of contamination
- Column chartcomparing which stations within provinces had the highest averages

## Data Cleaning Process
My data cleaning process consisted of copying the original dataset to create a version to work with. I then took time to familiarize myself with the topic, understanding the different column headers and which columns would be most relevant to answer my business task.
